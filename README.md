Steam's: Toy Soldiers Warchest - Hall of Fame Edition

Unofficial Troubleshooter! -ie how to make the game work again!
---------------------------------------------------------------

I've been wanting to get this working for quite a while, after some tips from some people online I decided to make this process easier and put my own touches into this.


I have included an installer here that will allow this game to function with no system wide time changes in 2025 and beyond.



Also I included a developer console program i wrote (that without needing a gamepad trick) that allows you to activate or deactivate it using the grave (`) key or backspace, enter and error keys change things and escape closes it.


This will allow you to get the dlc you bought to work again like in the tutorial found here:

After much frustration, I found the solution to my DLC character problems with the little trick above! note: I forgot to mention, you have to open up the dev menu EVERY time to enter the game as the...


*Note: if you hit the enter key while in the dev console and the music stops hit enter again and it will start again that is an issue with the original dev console. If the music isn't playing the dlc unlock will not work!

ie:

.\Hereos\..

UnlockAll false > true

= DLC Works!

*This does have to be run everytime still!

Included in the installer are various troubleshooting tools including allowing the game to launch without steam or without uplay or both as well. If you are utilizing the offline launcher I included a generator that will create a profile if you happen to know your real info you can enter it here for troubleshooting purposes and the save games will work accurately.

Tool usage! Edit
Running the installer it will first detect or install ViGEmBus program for using joystick emulation on Windows. You may already have this if you use streaming programs like sunshine/apollo moonlight/artemis.


Then you will have to accept the license agreement:


BY: credit must be given to the creator(s).

NC: Only noncommercial uses of the work are permitted.

SA: Adaptations must be shared under the same terms.

Then you will select the directory where steam has installed the game defaults to here:


When launching via shortcut the installer makes, or toysoldiers.cmd, the magic will do the tricks for you.


Then, when you want to use the developer console needed when you need it is needed to enable your purchased DLC. Just press the grave button on the keyboard, or backspace.


Then use the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate.


Enter key on keyboard selects options.

And Esc key exits and deactivates the developer console. Once the game exists, the launcher will make sure everything is closed, so don't close the black window; just alt-tab it away.
